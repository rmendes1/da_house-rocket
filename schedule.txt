Modifications for the next day (18/11/2021):

Try to put the season indication on plots somehow. The season needs to be
shown. The groupby you did previously had had the indications of season, but
in the actual plot that is not portrayed.

End this stage of development and head to business questions implementation.


Modifications for the next day (19/11/2021):

Implement the map. It should be below the data overview.

Modifications for the next day (21/11/2021):

Finish implementing the second map (column 2). 
Find a way to set the colors to a good scale with good color visibility
Search more about percentage in bar graphs. If you cannot find, let it go.
